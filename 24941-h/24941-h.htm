<h2>THREADING THE NEEDLE.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/w.png" width="75" height="79" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HERE is Lucy all this while?" asked Mrs.
Ludlow of Anna, the maid.</div>

<p>"I left her five minutes ago, trying to thread
a needle," replied Anna.</p>

<p>"She is a long while about it," said Mrs.
Ludlow. "Send her to me."</p>

<p>When Lucy entered the room, her mother asked her
what she had been about; and Lucy replied, "I have been
teaching myself to thread a needle."</p>

<p>"But you have been a long time about it," said mother.</p>

<p>"I will tell you why," continued Lucy. "When I went
to walk with papa yesterday, he saw me get over a stone-wall,
which I did rather clumsily: so he said, 'A thing that
is worth doing at all is worth doing well. Let me teach
you how to get over a wall quickly and gracefully.'"</p>

<p>"So he gave you a lesson in getting over walls, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother: he kept me at it at least half an hour;
and now I can get over a wall as quickly and well as any
boy."</p>

<p>"But what has getting over walls to do with threading
a needle?"</p>

<p>"Only this: I thought I would apply papa's rule, and
learn to do well what I was trying to do. So I have been
threading and unthreading the needle, till now I can thread
it easily."</p>

<p>"You have done well to heed your father's advice," said
Mrs. Ludlow. "If you do not see the importance of it
now, you will see it often in your life as you grow older."</p>

<p>It was not many months before Lucy comprehended how
wise her father had been in training his little girl. She
was gathering violets in a field one day, when she heard a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
trampling sound, and, looking round, saw a fierce bull plunging
and twisting himself about, and all the time drawing
nearer and nearer to her. Suddenly he made a rush towards
her in a straight line.</p>

<p>Not far off was a high stone-wall. It would once have
seemed to Lucy a hopeless attempt to try to get over it
before the bull could reach her; but now she felt confident
she could do it: and she did it bravely. Confidence in her
ability to do it kept off all fear; and she did not even
tremble.</p>

<p>The bull came up, and roared lustily when he found she
had escaped, and was on the other side of the wall. But
Lucy turned to him, and said, "Keep your temper, old fellow!
This child's father taught her how to get over a
stone-wall in double-quick time. You must learn to scale
a wall yourself, if you hope to catch <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"Boo-oo-oo!" roared the bull, prancing up and down,
but not knowing how to get over.</p>

<p>"Why, what a sweet humor you are in to-day, sir!" said
Lucy, walking away, and arranging her bunch of violets for
Cousin Susan as she went.</p>

<h2>THE BUTTER SONG.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was a little boy, I often helped my mother when
she was making butter.</p>

<p>I liked to stand in the cool spring-house, and churn for a
little while; but I liked better to look out of the window,
and watch the ducks swimming in the creek, or the little
shiners and sunfish darting back and forth through the clear
bright water.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would forget all about my work, and stand
watching the insects, ducks, and fishes, until some one
would call me, and tell me to go to work again.</p>

<p>One day I wanted to churn very fast; for my mother had
told me that I might take a swim in the creek when my
work was done.</p>

<p>So I sang a little song that our German girl Bertha had
taught me. She called it the "Butter Song;" and here it
is:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come, butter, come!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little Harry at the gate</span><br />
For his buttered bread does wait:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come, butter, come!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come, butter, come!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fish for Lent, eggs for Easter,</span><br />
Butter for all days, butter, come faster:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come, butter, come!</span><br />
</div>

<p>I thought then, as Bertha told me, that if I sang that
song a hundred and eleven times, and didn't stop churning
once while singing it, the butter would soon be made. I
believe so yet; but I think now, that the <i>steady work</i> had
more to do with it than the song had.</p>

<h2>THE SINGING MOUSE.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Have</span> you ever heard of singing mice? There are such creatures, you
must know, or you will not believe what my verses will tell you. Yes,
indeed: it was only the other day that I heard of one that was kept in a
little cage, like those used for squirrels, and sang so delightfully that her
owner used to have her by his bedside to charm him to sleep. She was
a wood-mouse. Wood-mice are the best singers. Whether the one about
which you shall hear came from the woods or not, I cannot say; nor
how she happened to be in my friend C.'s house: but there she certainly
was; and this is the story of what she did there. I call it,</p></div>


<div class='center'>SERENADE.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
A certain friend William I have, who's so nice,<br />
He's charming to every one,&mdash;even to mice.<br />
<br />
You ask how I know it? Well, listen: I'll tell<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Of something which proves it, that lately befell.<br />
<br />
One night, when young William was snugly in bed,<br />
A very queer notion came into his head.<br />
<br />
He woke from his slumbers, quite sure that he heard<br />
The musical warbling of some little bird.<br />
<br />
He listened a moment: all silent, and then<br />
The sweet little songster was singing again.<br />
<br />
A lamp, dimly burning, gave light in the room:<br />
Will raised his head softly, and peered through the gloom.<br />
<br />
The door was wide open; and there, on the sill<br />
(It's true, on my word: let them doubt it who will),<br />
<br />
A mite of a mousie sat singing away<br />
As sweetly as bobolink on a June day.<br />
<br />
Erect on her haunches, her head in the air;<br />
That Pussy might catch her she seemed not to care,<br />
<br />
But sang till her sweet serenade was quite done;<br />
Then ran away swiftly as mousie could run.<br />
<br />
Now, said I not truly, that Willy's so nice,<br />
He's charming to every one,&mdash;even to mice?<br />

<h2>OUR PONY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have a pony whose name is Duke. He was very
skittish when we first had him. There are four of us children
who ride him,&mdash;Mamie, Winnie, Arthur, and myself.
We have another little sister, Florence; but she is not old
enough to ride, being only five years old.</p>

<p>Winnie is a nice little rider. Duke was Mamie's birthday
present. We were all very much pleased when he
came. We danced round him, and clapped our hands.
Mamma wanted to surprise us: so, while we were at dinner,
she had the pony brought up and put in the barn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner we went out to play; and Winnie saw the
whip and the saddles, and then she suspected something.
So she began looking around in the stalls. There she found
the pony, and then came running in to mamma to ask if
it was really ours. Mamma said, Yes.</p>

<p>Then we were very much pleased, and said we would ride
him. Winnie rode him up to the house first; then Mamie
wanted to ride, so she got on the boys' saddle. Duke
would not stand still for her; and, when she got on, he went
galloping down to the barn. Her hat flew off, and she was
very much frightened. She kept calling out, "Stop him!"
but he would not stop until he reached the barn. Duke
was frightened too, because we shouted at him.</p>

<p>Mamie is thirteen, but is more afraid to ride than Winnie,
who is only seven. Mamie asks if boys always ride better
than girls. I say, "No! Look at Winnie." Once we tied
Duke to the swing; and then he got his nose pulled by getting
the rope twisted round it. Sometimes we have a good
frolic with him in the pasture. He never kicks us.</p>

<p>Mamie loves to feed Duke; but she wants Arthur to hold
him carefully by the bridle while she does it. As for Winnie,
she loves to gallop over the hills and far away. Sometimes
she lets me ride behind her. Duke seems to love the
bold Winnie, and will do whatever she tells him to.</p>

<h2>NELLY'S KITTEN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nelly's</span> kitten was the handsomest kitten that ever was.
So her little mistress thought. Nelly made a great pet of
her, and brought her up with great care; and, when she had
become a well-grown cat, Nelly gave her the name of
"Pussy Gray."</p>

<p>One morning while Nelly was being dressed, her sister
told her there was something nice down stairs, and asked
her to guess what it was. "I guess it's pickled limes," said
Nelly; for she dearly loved pickled limes. But her sister
said "No."&mdash;"Then I guess it's kittens," said Nelly; and
so it was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Out in the back-room, in a barrel of shavings, were two
little bunches of fur; and, when Nelly took them out and
put them on the floor, they looked as though they were all
legs and mouths. Their eyes were shut tight, and their
little pink mouths were wide open.</p>

<p>But, in a week or two, the eyes came open, and the little
kitties saw their feet and tails for the first time. Then they
stood upon their feet, and played with their tails till they
found their mother had one that was bigger and longer; and
then they played with their mother's tail whenever she forgot
to tuck it away and put her paw on it.</p>

<p>The kittens were always in somebody's way. When
Nelly's mamma sat down in the big rocking-chair for a little
rest, the first time she rocked back, "Mew, mew, mew!"
would be heard, and away would scamper a little kit.</p>

<p>When Nelly's sister walked across the room in the dark,
she was sure to hit her foot against a little soft ball, and
"Oh, dear! there's one of the kittens," she would say.</p>

<p>If mamma went out to work in the kitchen, there would
be a scampering from under her feet; and the kittens would
be right before her. If she went to the closet to get any
thing, she was sure to knock one of the kits over as she
came out. When she was making pies, something would
come up her dress; and, before she could stop it, there would
be a kitten on her shoulder ready to fall into the pie.</p>

<p>One day, after mamma had stepped on kittens, and fallen
over kittens, till her patience was all gone, she said she believed
she must have the kittens drowned, they were so
much in the way. Pussy Gray, their mother, was in the
room, and heard what was said. She at once went out of
the door, calling the kittens after her.</p>

<p>That night they didn't come back, nor the next day, nor
the next; and, now that they were really gone, mamma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
began to feel badly. So she searched all through the garden,
calling "Kitty, kitty;" but though she looked down
the cellar-stairs, and under the back-doorsteps, and everywhere
she could think of, no kitten came.</p>

<h2>A MORNING RIDE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Maud</span> is spending her vacation among the woods and
mountains of Maine, where she went with her father and
mother about two weeks ago.</p>

<p>One very pleasant morning papa said, "I think we had
better take a ride this morning." So Maud was called in
to get ready; and Hannah, the good white horse, was harnessed
into the buggy.</p>

<p>The buggy had but one seat: so mamma found a nice
box, and folded her shawl and put on it; and that made a
good place for the little girl, between her father and mother;
and they all started on their ride.</p>

<p>They went along a shady road near the river, and soon
they saw some geese. Several of them were swimming in
the water, and one or two were on the bank. One of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
had a sort of frame around its neck, and was standing on
one leg.</p>

<p>Maud said, "Why, see that poor goose! It has only one
leg; and they have put that frame on so it can walk better."
But a few minutes after she looked again, and the goose
was standing very comfortably on both feet. So it really
had two, but had been curling up
one of them quite out of sight.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/illus109a.png" width="150" height="110" alt="Geese" title="Geese" />
</div>

<p>After riding some time, they
came to a ferry,&mdash;a place for crossing
the Androscoggin River; and
papa drove through a pleasant
field down to the bank of the
river. Here they saw a man cutting grass, and asked him
about the ferry-boat. He came up and took a horn that
hung on a post, and blew a blast, which the ferry-boy on
the other side of the river heard.</p>

<p>When the boy heard it, he began to unfasten his boat,
and pull it over; and Maud and her father and mother
waited, sitting in the buggy, until the boy brought his boat
close to the shore, so that they could drive on to it easily.</p>

<p>Then papa said, "Are you all ready?" and the boy answered,
"Yes, sir;" and Hannah walked on the boat and
stood perfectly still, while the boy kept pulling a strong
rope, until he drew the boat, with the horse and buggy and
people, safely over to the other
side. Then they drove up the
bank of the river, and came to a
gate, which a little girl opened.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/illus109b.png" width="150" height="121" alt="Ferry" title="Ferry" />
</div>

<p>Next they came to a very pleasant
wood,&mdash;so pleasant that papa
stopped Hannah in the shade, and
said she might rest a little; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
mamma and Maud got out of the buggy, and picked the
young boxberry-leaves, and the red berries, and pulled long
vines of evergreen, and gathered moss.</p>

<p>When papa thought it was time to go, he said, "All
aboard!" and they got in, and he drove on. They had not
gone far when Maud asked if she might drive. So papa
handed her the reins; and Hannah seemed to go on just as
well as ever.</p>

<p>After Maud had been driving a little while, her father said
he thought she had better give the reins to him. This she
did, and they went to the village, stopped at the post-office,
and then drove swiftly home in season for dinner.</p>

<h2>OLD TRIM.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Here's</span> brave old Trim: I once with him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was walking near the docks;</span><br />
We heard a cry, both Trim and I,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cry that always shocks.</span><br />
<br />
"Help! boat, ahoy! See, there's a boy:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make haste, he's going down."</span><br />
"There! watch him, Trim! in after him!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We must not let him drown."</span><br />
<br />
Through foam and splash Trim's quick eyes flash:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He strikes out to the place;</span><br />
And round and round, with eager bound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He watches for a trace.</span><br />
<br />
A little hand comes paddling up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A face so wild and wan:</span><br />
"Ah, Trim, he's there! Make haste, take care;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And save him if you can!"</span><br />
<br />
Oh! brave and bold, he seizes hold;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His teeth are firmly set:</span><br />
Now bear him near; there is no fear:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The boy is breathing yet.</span><br />
<br />
"Bravo, good Trim!" They welcome him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And clasp him round for joy;</span><br />
Then homeward bear, with tender care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pale, half-conscious boy.</span><br />
<br />
O faithful Trim! "Would I sell him?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inquired a curious elf:</span><br />
"What, sell," I cried, "a friend so tried!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd rather sell myself."</span><br />

<h2>PERILS OF THE SEA.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Edwin</span> had a present of a ship, sent to him from England;
and he named it, after the giver, "The Uncle George." It
was a splendid ship. It had three masts, as a ship ought to
have, and was rigged in complete style.</p>

<p>One fine day last month, Edwin took his ship down to the
Frog Pond on Boston Common, and set her afloat. On the
opposite side of the pond he saw four boys sailing their
boats, and a tall boy carrying a sloop, and followed by his
small brother.</p>

<p>A sloop, you know, has but one mast. None of these
boys had a ship with three masts, like "The Uncle George."
Edwin felt a little proud when he saw his good ship catch the
wind in her sails, and go plunging up and down over the pond.</p>

<p>But, dear me, think of the risks of ship-owners! Consider,
too, that Edwin's ship was not insured. What, then,
was his dismay, when, as she got into the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean (for so Edwin called the pond), a flaw of
wind threw her on her beam-ends, and sent her masts down
under water till she foundered, sank, and disappeared.</p>

<p>There was a shout from the owners of vessels on the
other side of the Atlantic Ocean. "What a pity!" exclaimed
the boy with a dog.</p>

<p>"What's her name?" asked the tall boy.</p>

<p>"The Uncle George!" shouted back Edwin.</p>

<p>"Any insurance on her?" inquired a boy waving his hat.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by insurance?" asked Edwin.</p>

<p>"Go and look in your dictionary," said the boy with his
hat off.</p>

<p>Then the tall boy repeated these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"A land-breeze shook her shrouds, and she was overset;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down went 'The Royal George' with all her crew complete."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>Edwin was half disposed to cry; but then he thought
that crying was no way to get out of trouble. He took a
survey of the Atlantic Ocean, and wondered how deep it
was where his ship wend down.</p>

<p>Then taking off his shoes and stockings, and rolling up
his pantaloons, he waded in, and succeeded, with the aid of
a long stick, in saving "The Uncle George."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Well done, little one!" shouted a boy on the
other side. The tall boy again launched into poetry, and
cried out,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Weigh the vessel up, once dreaded by our foes!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her timbers yet are sound; and she may float again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Full charged with England's thunder, and plough the distant main."</span><br />

<h2>WALTER'S DISAPPOINTMENT.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Here</span> is the last white rose in my garden," said Laura
to her brother Walter; "and you shall have it if you will
be a good boy."</p>

<p>"I don't want a white rose," said Walter; "and, if I can't
go with Jim Bacon and the other fellows on the pond, I'll
not be a good boy: I'll make myself as disagreeable as I
can."</p>

<p>"Why, Walter, what a threat!" said Laura, laughing;
"but you are a good deal like the minister's dog Bunkum,
who barks terribly, but never bites."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"See what I get for being a good boy!" replied Walter.
"The first time a chance for a little fun comes along, then
it's, 'O Walter! you and the other boys are too young to be
trusted alone on the water.'"</p>

<p>Hardly had Walter given utterance to these words, when
there were cries from the roadside near by; and men and
women were seen running towards the pond. What could
be the matter?</p>

<p>It soon was made known what the matter was. The little
fellows in the boat had upset it; and five of them were
floundering about in the water. Fortunately no life was
lost. All were saved, but not until all were wet through to
the skin.</p>

<p>"Now, Walter," said Laura, "are you going to fret, and
make yourself disagreeable, because you did not get a ducking
with the other boys?"</p>

<p>"Sister," said Walter, with a smile, "I think I will accept
that beautiful white rose you offered me just now."</p>

<h2>THE BOASTING BOY.</h2>

I <span class="smcap">knew</span> a boy in our town, whose name was Billy Hood:<br />
He had a sword all made of tin, a musket made of wood.<br />
His drum would always let you know when Billy Hood was coming;<br />
For all the neighbors used to say, "I wish he'd stop that drumming."<br />
<br />
Now, very brave this Billy was,&mdash;at least, so Billy thought;<br />
And he was not afraid,&mdash;not he,&mdash;of any thing that fought.<br />
"With this good sword and gun," said he, "I'll fight until I die:<br />
Let man or beast come on! Who fears? Not Billy Hood! Not I!"<br />
<br />
But ah! one day this Billy went where six old geese were straying,<br />
And on his noisy drum began somewhat too loudly playing:<br />
An old goose chased him from the field; and Billy, screaming, ran,<br />
Till on the kitchen floor he sank,&mdash;that valiant little man!<br />

<h2>THE TIDE COMING IN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span> and Rose were on a visit to their uncle, who lived
near the seaside. They came from Ohio, and did not know
about the ebb and flow of the tide of the ocean. They ran
down on the sandy beach, and seated themselves on a rock.</p>

<p>Their cousin Rodney was not far off, engaged in fishing
for perch. All at once there was a loud cry from Julia, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
elder of the two sisters. The water had crept up all round
the rock on which they sat, thus forming an island of it;
and they did not know what to make of it.</p>

<p>"The water has changed its place," shouted Rose.</p>

<p>Rodney was alarmed, and began to blame himself for
neglecting, in his eagerness to catch a few fish, the little
girls under his charge.</p>

<p>He took off his shoes and stockings, rolled up his pantaloons,
and ran into the water over the sandy bottom to the
rock. Taking Rose in his arms, he told Julia to follow.</p>

<p>"But I shall wet my nice boots," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Then, wait on the rock," said Rodney, "while I carry
Rose, and set her down on dry land. I will then come for
you, and carry you pickback to the shore."</p>

<p>"No, Cousin Rodney," said Julia: "I think I will not
ride pickback. I should be too heavy a load. I must not
mind wetting my boots and stockings."</p>

<p>"Then, place your hand on my shoulder, and come along,"
said Rodney. "The tide is gaming on us very fast."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by the tide," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Why, cousin," said Rodney, "you must know that the
tides are the rise and fall of the waters of the ocean. It
will be high tide an hour from now; then the water will
cover all these rocks you see around us. After that, the
water will sink and go back till we can see the rocks again,
and walk a long way on the sand; then it will be low
tide. But we must not stay here talking: the water will
soon be too deep for us."</p>

<p>So Rodney took Rose in his arms, and Julia placed her
left hand on his right shoulder; and in this way they went
through the water to the dry part of the beach.</p>

<p>"We must look out for this sly tide the next time," said
little Rose as she ran to tell papa of their adventure.</p>

smell of one: so he
put his nose close to
the little soft bunch, and smelt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of it. But the chicken's mother
put her head out of the coop,
and pecked him so that he
cried.</div>

<h2>PEEPY'S PET.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a little girl who was called Peepy; but why
she was called so I do not know: perhaps it was because,
when a baby, she used to peep from behind a curtain or a
door, and cry, "Peep-O!"</p>

<p>She was a good little girl; but, when she was five years
old, her mother had to go to Europe for her health, and
Peepy was sent to board in the family of a farmer whose
name was Miller.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Miller made her a present of a bright silver
quarter of a dollar. Peepy had been taught to sew by
Susan Miller; and so Peepy put her work-box on a chair
in her little room, and sat down and made a little bag in
which to keep the bright silver coin.</p>

<p>Then she took a walk near the grove, and saw two boys
who had caught a robin, and were playing with it. They
had tied a string to its legs; and, when the poor bird tried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
fly away, they pulled it back again, and laughed at its
struggles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus125.png" width="300" height="227" alt="&quot;How can you be so cruel?&quot;" title="&quot;How can you be so cruel?&quot;" />
</div>

<p>At last the little robin was so tired and frightened, that it
lay on the ground, panting, with its feathers ruffled, and its
beak wide open, and its eyes half closed. It seemed ready
to die. Then the rude, cruel boys pulled the string to
make it fly again.</p>

<p>"Please don't be so cruel," said little Peepy. "How can
you be so cruel?" And she ran to the poor bird, and took
it up very gently.</p>

<p>"You let our bird alone!" one of the boys cried out. But
Peepy still held it, and was ready to cry when she felt its
little heart beating with fear.</p>

<p>"Do give it to me, please," said Peepy. "I will thank
you for it very much." But the boys laughed at her, and
told her roughly to let the bird alone. "We caught the
bird, and the bird is ours," said one of them.</p>

<p>"Will you sell me the bird?" asked Peepy, taking her
bright quarter of a dollar out of its bag, and offering it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus126.png" width="300" height="232" alt="Peepy, Mrs. Miller and Bella at home" title="Peepy, Mrs. Miller and Bella at home" />
</div>

<p>"Ah! now you talk sensibly," said the larger of the
boys. "Yes: we'll sell it."</p>

<p>So Peepy parted with her money, but kept the precious
bird. The boys ran off, knowing they had done a mean
thing, and fearing some man might come along, and inquire
into it.</p>

<p>Peepy took the bird home; and Mrs. Miller told her
she had done right, and helped her to mend an old cage
into which they could put the poor little bruised bird.
Soon it took food from their hands, and grew quite tame.</p>

<p>Peepy named it Bella, and kept it in her chamber where
she could hear it sing. Bella loved Peepy, and would fly
about the room, and light on her head, and play with her
curls.</p>

<p>But as summer came on, and the weather grew warm and
pleasant, Peepy thought to herself, "Bella loves me, and is
grateful for all my care; but liberty is as sweet to birds as
to little girls. I will not selfishly keep this bird in prison.
I will take it into the grove, and set it free."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus127.png" width="400" height="310" alt="Peepy setting Bella free" title="Peepy setting Bella free" />
</div>

<p>So Peepy took it into the grove, and set it free; and Bella
lighted on a bough, and sang the sweetest song you ever
heard. It then flew singing round Peepy's head, as if to
say, "Thank you! thank you a thousand times, you dear
little girl!" If Bella's song could have been translated
into words, I think they would have been these:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Darling little Peepy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">When you're sad or sleepy,</span><br />
I will come and sing you a merry, merry song:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">So do not be grieving</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">At this tender leaving;</span><br />
I shall not forget you, dear, for Oh! love is strong."<br />
</div>

<p>Peepy went home rather sad with her empty cage. But
what was her joy the next day, to see Bella on the window-sill!
She opened the window, Bella flew in, and they had a
nice frolic. Then, when the dinner-bell rang, the little bird
flew off. Peepy was happy to think it had not forgotten
her.</p>
